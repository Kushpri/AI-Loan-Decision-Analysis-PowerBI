# AI Loan Decision Audit & Operations Intelligence Platform (Power BI)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project delivers an **end-to-end analytical audit layer** for AI-driven loan approval decisions using **Power BI**.

The platform is designed to **monitor, interpret, and govern AI decision outcomes**, with a focus on:
- Approval behavior  
- Risk distribution  
- Model confidence  
- Fairness across income and location segments  

The objective is not just visualization, but **decision intelligence** — enabling stakeholders to understand *how* and *where* AI decisions may require oversight or intervention.

---

## 🎯 Business Problem Addressed
AI systems increasingly automate loan approvals, but organizations often lack:
- Visibility into approval vs rejection patterns  
- Confidence–risk alignment checks  
- Fairness analysis across demographic groups  
- Human-in-the-loop audit readiness  

This project acts as a **decision audit & monitoring layer**, supporting:
- Risk governance  
- Model accountability  
- Policy-driven reviews

## 📊 Dashboards Overview

### 1️⃣ Executive Summary
High-level KPIs designed for leadership and risk stakeholders:
- Total Loan Applications  
- Overall Approval Rate (%)  
- Average AI Confidence Score  
- AI Approval vs Rejection split  
- Application Volume by Risk Level  
- Executive insights highlighting decision trends  

---

### 2️⃣ Decision Analysis
Deeper analytical views to assess fairness, risk, and confidence alignment:
- AI Approval vs Rejection by Income Group (100% stacked)  
- Distribution of AI Confidence Scores  
- Approval distribution by Location Type (Urban / Semi-Urban / Rural)  
- Risk-based application volume  
- Interactive slicers for location-based drill-downs  
- Analytical summary explaining observed patterns  

---

## 📈 Key Analytical Insights
- Majority of applications fall under **Low Risk**, driving most approvals  
- Overall approval rate (~34.5%) reflects **conservative AI decisioning**  
- Rejections outweigh approvals, indicating **strict risk thresholds**  
- Approval rates improve with **higher income groups**  
- **Urban and Semi-Urban** locations show higher approval likelihood than Rural  
- AI confidence scores cluster at lower values, signaling **cautious predictions**  
- Confidence–risk alignment highlights areas suitable for **human review**
